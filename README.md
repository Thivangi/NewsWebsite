# WUSTL News
This is a project I completed for CSE330, Rapid Prototype Developement and Creative Programming. The goal of the project was to create a news site that allowed users to write, comment on, like and view stories. 

Key Features:
- Users are able to create an account, login, create stories, edit stories, create comments on stories, edit comments and like stories. 
- Web security features: Hashing of passwords, safe from SQL injection attacks, CSRF tokens are used to prevent cross-site request forgeries. 
- "Trending Articles" section shows the most liked stories
